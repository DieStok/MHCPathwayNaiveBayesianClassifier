# MHCPathwayNaiveBayesianClassifier
Major research project intended to infer candidate genes involved in the MHC pathway from publically available data and a positive set of known MHC pathway genes.
Read the report (under ImportantDocumentation/Writing) for details on the work and methods. Programming contains dataset and scripts used to process the data. Note that the code was not made to be publication-ready and represents my first foray into completing a large-scale bioinformatic research project. Hence, the code will not work out-of-the-box. Conducted under the auspices of Dr. Can Kesmir and Dr. T.J.P. van Dam.
