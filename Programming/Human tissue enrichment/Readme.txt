Uses immunohistochemistry data on specific human tissues from The Human Protein Atlas to check for high expression in immune-related tissues (lymph nodes, lung macrophages, etc.).
MHC pathway genes are more highly expressed in these tissues, so being immunohistochemically present in immune tissues is one of the signatures for MHC pathway-ness. For documentation
of the methods, see the methods section of the project report under ImportantDocumentation in this repo.
