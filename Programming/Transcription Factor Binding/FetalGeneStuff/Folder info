At some point a question arose whether immune genes were expressed in fetuses. This because I had found many HOX gene motifs. As it turned out, that data was faulty, so the exercise was pointless. In the final Pouya Kheradpour data, only 3 HOX genes are found. In earlier versions using 29 mammals, almost everything was HOX genes. That is why we wished to look at fetal expression.

Disregard. This is archive stuff.
