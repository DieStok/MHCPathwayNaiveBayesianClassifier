This directory contains data on positive set genes, which are used for getting Bayesian scores for all data sets. It also contains the identifiers for all Ensembl protein-coding
genes used (from the GRCH38.p10 version). The csv-file called PositiveList_2.csv was used as the final set of positive genes (i.e. genes known to be involved in the MHC
pathway).
