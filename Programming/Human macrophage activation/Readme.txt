This directory contains data, scripts, and description of workflow for gene regulation upon activation of M1 macrophages. Genes co-upregulated or co-downregulated with 
known MHC genes are more likely to be involved in the MHC pathway themselves. The analysis uses STEM to generate gene expression change profiles, similar to the
approach used in the paper this data is from (Derlindati, E. et al. Transcriptomic analysis of human polarized macrophages: More than one role of alternative activation? PLoS One 10, 1 17 (2015).)
